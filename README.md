# Variations on a Seitanic Theme

Here I'm collected a bunch of 'recipes' I have for seitan. They are all variation on this [chickwheat shreds](https://avocadosandales.com/2017/12/17/chickwheat-shreds/) recipe, in that they are all made roughly the same way:
1. All ingredients save the vital wheat gluten are processed together in a slurry.
2.  Said slurry is mixed with vital wheat gluten and allowed to rest for a while.
3.  The mixture is beaten to hell, wrapped in foil, and pressure cooked for a couple hours.

That's basically it.

`Coalesce into one, your gluten and broth,
Soon you will meet the wet bread.
Enter to the Realm of Seitan!`
