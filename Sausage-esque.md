# The Slurry
* The usual amount of beans and gluten. This time I used yellow-eyed peas for the bean.
* A small can of sliced beets, juice and all.
* Half a large onion that's been resting in the fridge for awhile.
* No extra liquid
* One of those Edward & Son's Not-Chick'n bouillon cubes
* Two dried hot red peppers
* The usual salt and garlic powder
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil
* About half a tablespoon of brown sugar
* About a tablespoon of malt vinegar
* Probably half a tablespoon of smoked paprika
* Not enough smokiness, so some liquid smoke, too
* Fennel and sage, I'm guessing half a tablespoon of each

# The Finishers
When I'm ready to throw the mixture back in the food processor to get beat up again, I sometimes throw a little extra something in with it. This time it was half a tablespoon of both brown sugar and dill with each half of the mixture.
